                <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Welcome to <q>Tangled Choices</q> website, created for the Creative Computing Project 2. This project explores the concept of "tangled systems," illustrating how:</p>
        <p2><q>The everyday objects and structures that surround us are constructed on networks of production that run across the physical and digital realms, spanning different time zones - past, present, and future.</q></p2>

        <h3>The Concept</h3>
        <p>This project focuses on the intricate web of connections between everyday personal choices and broader political policies. It aims to demonstrate how decisions in one area of life can have far-reaching and often unexpected consequences in others. For instance, a choice that seems to prioritize economic stability might inadvertently impact environmental and social stability, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>The goal is to encourage users to think critically about the choices while there are no "right" or "wrong" answers, it is aimed at the user to consider how these decisions might affect the environment, society, and the economy on both local and global scales. The purpose is to illustrate the complex interconnectedness of our choices and their impacts.</p>

        <h3>How to Interact</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>You will be presented with a series of prompts, each offering two choices.</li>
            <li>Select the option you prefer.</li>
            <li>Observe how your choice impacts three key areas of stability: Economic, Environmental, and Social.</li>
            <li>The graph below the prompts will update to show the consequences of your decision.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Understanding Stability Factors</h3>
        <p>To help you understand the results, here's a brief overview of some of the factors that contribute to or detract from each type of stability:</p>

        <h4>Economic Stability</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Positive factors:</strong> GDP growth, low unemployment, stable inflation, financial market stability</li>
            <li><strong>Negative factors:</strong> Economic recession, high unemployment, inflation, market crashes</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Environmental Stability</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Positive factors:</strong> Low pollution, biodiversity preservation, sustainable resource management, climate change mitigation, renewable energy adoption</li>
            <li><strong>Negative factors:</strong> Pollution, deforestation, climate change, resource depletion, natural disasters, loss of biodiversity</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Social Stability</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Positive factors:</strong> Low crime rates, high education levels, good healthcare, low poverty rates, social cohesion, equal opportunities, political stability</li>
            <li><strong>Negative factors:</strong> Crime, inequality, poverty, unemployment, social unrest, political instability</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Outcome</h3>
        <p>As you engage with the prompts and analyse the outcomes, you'll discover that our choices rarely affect just one aspect of stability. A decision aimed at boosting economic growth might have unforeseen environmental consequences, or a policy intended to protect the environment could have complex social repercussions.</p>
        <p>This project isn't about finding "correct" answers or perfect solutions. Instead, it's designed to illustrate the complexities of cause and effect that define our interconnected world. By exploring these scenarios, you'll gain insight into the ripple effects of individual and policy-level decisions.</p>
        <p>The challenges faced by decision-makers in balancing competing interests and the importance of considering long-term and wide-ranging impacts of our choices. I hope this experience encourages you to think critically about the choices you make in your daily life while considering the broader implications of policy decisions and appreciating the complexity of global systems and how they interact.</p>
        <p>In a tangled system, every thread you pull might tighten or loosen countless others. And the main question is how do we or can we make more informed choices in a world where everything is connected?</p>
